#Use the append method to add "orange" to the fruits list. ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

#Use the insert method to add "lemon" as the second item in the fruits list. ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

#Use the remove method to remove "banana" from the fruits list. ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

#Use negative indexing to print the 3rd and 2nd to last items in the list. ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]

#Use a range of indexes to print the third, fourth, and fifth item in the list. ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]

#Use the correct syntax to print the number of items in the list. ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]

#Use the correct syntax to sort this list in reverse order ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
