    "  1. What kind of language is Python considered?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "      * <font color=green>Python is a highly versatile, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that can be used for small and complex tasks such as: backend development, software development, data science, and writing system scripts (automation) across many different industries.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Whatâ€™s a natural language?\n",
    "\n",
    "      * <font color=green>Natural Languages are mostly spoken languages that form on their own. Slang is a great example of a natural language.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Is Python a Natural or a Formal language?\n",
    "\n",
    "      * <font color=green>Python is formal language designed by people. There are formal rules about grammar, syntax, and punctuation.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. What are Algorithms?\n",
    "\n",
    "      * <font color=green>An algorithm is a series of steps to solve a problem at hand.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Why is Python considered to be a high-level language?\n",
    "\n",
    "      * <font color=green>Because Python takes less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct/error free when we run them.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. What is a Semantic error?\n",
    "\n",
    "      * <font color=green>Code is grammatically correct but doesn't make any sense; it does not produce the expected results.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. What is the #1 rule of coding / debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "      * <font color=green>The #1 Rule: Complexity is the enemy of efficiency!</font>"
