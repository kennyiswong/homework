    "1. Create a file and name it 3.1-Homework\n",
    "    - A Jupyter Notebook file would probably work best as you would want to type some answers to questions and code for this homework.\n",
    "    - Decorate / beautify your markdown in any way your like.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open a Markdown cell in your Jupyter Notebook and answer these questions please:\n",
    "    - Use a markdown numbered list to answer these questions.\n",
    "    - What is an algorithm?\n",
    "    - Why is Python considered to be a high-level language?\n",
    "    - Is Python a Natural or a Formal language?\n",
    "    - Variable names may not start with certain characters - name two.\n",
    "    - WHat is a Semantic error?\n",
    "    - What is the #1 rule of coding / debugging?\n",
    "    - list 5 Python reserved words.\n",
    "    - add and name, a web link for any Python coding article, in your markdown cell\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Open a code cell in your Jupyter Notebook and write the following code:\n",
    "    - Write a multi-line comment with your name, favorite food, and dream job on 3 different lines.\n",
    "    - assign 5 different data types to 5 different variables. At least one datatype must be a string.\n",
    "    - print the length of your string.\n",
    "    - print the the index value of the 4th character in your string.\n",
    "    - create a new variable called savvy, and assign it the string with this phrase \"Learning Data Analytics and Python is Awesome!\"\n",
    "    - return a range of characters that slices the above string from the beginning of  \"ing\" up to before \"and\"\n",
    "    - Replace \"Awesome\" with \"great\" in the string\n",
    "    - Test and print the savvy string to see it contains \"Python\"\n",
    "    - Create and assign 3 more variables called name, age and length using the multi-variable  naming method.\n",
    "    - Format a new string called 'miniBio' using variables in curly brackets to complete this phrase...\n",
    "            \"Hi my name is (name), I am (tall) and (so) old today.\"\n",
    "    - print 'miniBio'\n",
    "    - cast and print the age variable to a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Save your file in your homework folder, and push it to GitHub.\n",
    "    - Once you have complete all your homework for the week, create a ticket to let the TAs know you have completed it.\n",
    "    - Remember to add the link to you homework, to the ticket.\n",

    "When homework has been completed, do the following...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure your homework file is well named\n",
    "- Add the homework to your Homework folder\n",
    "- Use  git add, git commit, and git push to upload your homework changes to GitHub in the cloud\n",
    "- When all you homework has been completed, create a ticket in Jira to indicate that your Homework is ready for review\n"
